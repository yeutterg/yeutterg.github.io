## <a name="cars"></a> Self-Driving Cars

More cars are going to drive without human assistance than not within a few short years. There are political and economic questions that need to be resolved, but technological forces make self-driving cars inevitable. In these projects, I explore various components of self-driving cars, from sensors to vehicle models to safety.

Most of these projects were completed as part of [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

### Lane Line Detection

A computer vision project to identify and mark lane lines in a video feed. This project was written in Python.

## <a name="visual"></a> Visual Computing

As technology advances, art is never more than a step behind. Some may say art pushes the limits of technology. I've always been interested in visual art that takes advantage of the latest tech.

The projects below range from infographics and animations generated in [Processing](https://processing.org/) to an animated holiday light show I built for 14 years.

### <a name="nyc_display"></a> New York City Holiday Window Display

During the holiday 2017 season, I provided the lighting design and implementation for a Twitter-controlled holiday window display made entirely of chocolate. The display was for a prominent retailer at Rockefeller Center.

### <a name="light_show"></a> Animated Holiday Light Show

From the age of six, I built a holiday light display that quickly grew out of control. It won the local contest so many times, it was disqualified. In the early 2000s, I discovered a community that was synchronizing lights to music, much like what is done at Disney theme parks. From 2005-2012, the display became a show, with 10s of thousands of lights dancing to a custom holiday soundtrack.

### Processing Examples

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a visual programming language used by artists, designers, and even scientists working with vast datasets. To learn what it can do, I've based several small projects off of various tutorials. My work is posted on the GitHub page [Fun with Processing](https://github.com/yeutterg/fun-with-processing).

These projects include:
* [The Matrix Raining Code Effect](https://github.com/yeutterg/fun-with-processing/tree/master/Matrix)
* [Map Visualization of Meteorite Strikes](https://github.com/yeutterg/fun-with-processing/tree/master/Meteors)

## <a name="voice"></a> Voice Computing

Alexa, Siri, and the Google Assistant are all competing to open up a relatively unexplored computer interfaceâ€”the voice. Voice interfaces allow us to transcend the smartphone and computer in various aspects of our lives. The project listed below was mostly an exercise to get familiar with the Alexa Skills platform, but you may find it instructive.

### Repeat This Alexa Skill

A simple skill for Amazon Alexa that repeats whatever it thinks the user said, written in Node.js. This skill is now obsolete because of recent API changes.

## <a name="utils"></a> Utilities

Various problem-solving utilities I've written.

### Public IP Utility

A simple utility to update a public IP address on Google Sheets, written in Python. This is useful for accessing port forwarded devices on a network with a dynamic IP address.
