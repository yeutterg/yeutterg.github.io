Hey, Greg here.

I'm committed to making light [simple](https://www.simplebulb.com/) and [healthy](https://greg.lighting/).

I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/gregyeutter), take [photos](https://www.instagram.com/gregyeutter/), and [write](https://medium.com/@yeutterg) a lot.

My curiosity leads me to a bunch of [projects](./projects) and [coding](https://github.com/yeutterg), all while drinking WAY too much tea.

I'm editing what I own. That includes my [gear](./what-i-use) and [wardrode](./what-i-wear).

Sometimes I get a moment in the [spotlight](./media-appearances).

I also publish a newsletter about once per week. Sign up [here](https://goo.gl/EpTQAA).

Let's [connect](./connect).
