# New York City Holiday Window Display

I provided the lighting design and implementation for a Twitter-controlled holiday window display at Rockefeller Center. The display was made entirely of chocolate and ran through the holiday 2017 season.

## Overview

I've always had a [strong interest](https://gregyeutter.com/christmas/) in entertainment lighting. In late 2017, an opportunity presented itself to light a window display in Rockefeller Center, right around the corner from the annual holiday tree and ice skating rink.

The display, made entirely of chocolate, is a scale replica of Rockefeller Center: the tree in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, an ice skater, the Prometheus statue, and numerous international flags. [Two](https://www.thechocolategenius.com) [experts](http://fortune.com/2016/11/30/chocolate-chef-godiva/) in the world of chocolate worked together to build the base display.

A display constructed entirely of chocolate was a feat in itself. But what holiday window in NYC would be complete without lighting? That's where I came in.

I worked for the [Experience Design Studio](http://madebyxds.com/) to design and implement the lighting experience. The lights, which were animated with a constant snowfall effect, could be controlled by Twitter. Remote users viewing a livestream could change the tree to 9 different colors.
